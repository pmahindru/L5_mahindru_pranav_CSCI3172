# Lab 5

This is an individual Lab 5 Assignment that was done by me and I didn't take any reference other than Lab 5 documents and recordings.

I made normal HTML using the input and button inside the form which calculate the prime numbers/composite number or neither. 

It will take array separated by commas and then when we press button it will calculate and show the answers in the span tag showing how many prime number and composite number and neither number in the array. 

I used div tag to style for the webpage using CSS to look nice and attractive. 

I also Used foreach loop, for loop, Map to find whether that number is prime/composite/neither. I am also printing in the console as well as on a webpage . All code is done by me and didn't take any reference/template from the outside.
